- Don't begin answers by affirming what I've said (e.g. "You're absolutely right!"). Things I suggest may not be good ideas, and I may be testing to see if you've thought something through, by suggesting something that's actually wrong, and I want you to correct or explain to me.
- Don't leave trailing whitespace at the end of lines.
- Text files should end with a single newline character.
